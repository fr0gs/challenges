        <h1>KEN THOMPSON</h1>
        <p>Kenneth Lane "Ken" Thompson (born February 4, 1943), commonly referred to as ken in hacker circles,
           is an American pioneer of computer science. Having worked at Bell Labs for most of his career, Thompson
           designed and implemented the original Unix operating system. He also invented the B programming language,
           the direct predecessor to the C programming language, and was one of the creators and early developers of
           the Plan 9 operating systems. Since 2006, Thompson has worked at Google, where he co-invented the Go programming language.</p>

                Thompson was born in New Orleans. When asked how he learned to program, Thompson stated, "I was always fascinated with logic
                and even in grade school I'd work on arithmetic problems in binary, stuff like that. Just because I was fascinated."

              <p>Thompson received a Bachelor of Science in 1965 and a Master's degree in 1966, both in Electrical Engineering and
                Computer Science, from the University of California, Berkeley, where his master's thesis advisor was Elwyn Berlekamp.
                In the 1960s at Bell Labs, Thompson and Dennis Ritchie worked on the Multics operating system. While writing Multics,
                Thompson created the Bon programming language. The two left the Multics project when Bell Labs withdrew from it, but
                they used the experience from the project. In 1969, Thompson and Ritchie became the principal creators of the Unix
                operating system. Working on a PDP-7, a team of Bell Labs researchers led by Thompson and Ritchie, and including Rudd
                Canaday, developed a hierarchical file system, the concepts of computer processes and device files, a command-line
                interpreter, and some small utility programs. After initial work on Unix, Thompson decided that Unix needed a system
                programming language and created B, a precursor to Ritchie's C.
                In the 1960s, Thompson also began work on regular expressions. Thompson had developed the CTSS version
                of the editor QED, which included regular expressions for searching text. QED and Thompson's later editor
                ed (the standard text editor on Unix) contributed greatly to the eventual popularity of regular expressions,
                and regular expressions became pervasive in Unix text processing programs. Almost all programs that work with regular
                expressions today use some variant of Thompson's notation. He also invented Thompson's construction algorithm used for
                converting regular expression into nondeterministic finite automaton in order to make expression matching faster.</p>

                Throughout the 1970s, Thompson and Ritchie collaborated on the Unix operating system; they were so influential on
                I did the first of two or three versions of UNIX all alone. And Dennis became an evangelist. Then there was a rewrite
                in a higher-level language that would come to be called C. He worked mostly on the language and on the I/O system, and
                I worked on all the rest of the operating system. That was for the PDP-11, which was serendipitous, because that was
                the computer that took over the academic community. Research Unix that Doug McIlroy later wrote, "The names of Ritchie
                and Thompson may safely be assumed to be attached to almost everything not otherwise attributed." In a 2011 interview,
                Thompson stated that the first versions of Unix were written by him, and that Ritchie began to advocate for the system
                and helped to develop it: Feedback from Thompson's Unix development was also instrumental in the development of the C
                programming language. Thompson would later say that the C language "grew up with one of the rewritings of the system and,
                as such, it became perfect for writing systems."
                In 1975, Thompson took a sabbatical from Bell Labs and went to his alma mater, UC Berkeley. There, he helped to install
                Version 6 Unix on a PDP-11/70. Unix at Berkeley would later become maintained as its own system, known as the Berkeley
                Software Distribution (BSD). Along with Joseph Condon, Thompson created the hardware and software for Belle, a world
                champion chess computer. He also wrote programs for generating the complete enumeration of chess endings, known as
                endgame tablebases, for all 4, 5, and 6-piece endings, allowing chess-playing computer programs to make "perfect" moves
                once a position stored in them is reached. Later, with the help of chess endgame expert John Roycroft, Thompson distributed
                his first results on CD-ROM.

                Throughout the 1980s, Thompson and Ritchie continued revising Research Unix, which adopted a BSD codebase for the 8th, 9th,
                and 10th editions. In the mid-1980s, work began at Bell Labs on a new operating system as a replacement for Unix.
                Thompson was instrumental in the design and implementation of the Plan 9 from Bell Labs, a new operating system utilizing
                principles of Unix, but applying them more broadly to all major system facilities. Some programs that were part of later
                versions of Research Unix, such as mk and rc, were also incorporated into Plan 9. Thompson tested early versions of the
                C++ programming language for Bjarne Stroustrup by writing programs in it, but later refused to work in C++ due to frequent
                incompatibilities between versions. In a 2009 interview, Thompson expressed a negative view of C++, stating, "It does a lot
                of things half well and it's just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive."

                In 1992, Thompson developed the UTF-8 encoding scheme together with Rob Pike. The UTF-8 encoding has become the
                dominant character encoding for the World Wide Web, accounting for more than half of all web pages.
                In the 1990s, work began on the Inferno operating system, another research operating system that was based around
                a portable virtual machine. Thompson and Ritchie continued their collaboration with Inferno, along with other
                researchers at Bell Labs.

                In late 2000, Thompson retired from Bell Labs. He worked at Entrisphere, Inc as a fellow until 2006 and now works at Google
                as a Distinguished Engineer. Recent work has included the co-design of the Go programming language. Referring to himself
                along with the other original authors of Go, he states: When the three of us [Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer]
                got started, it was pure research. The three of us got together and decided that we hated C++. [laughter] ... [Returning to Go,]
                we started off with the idea that all three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was no
                extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason.
                According to a 2009 interview, Thompson now uses a Linux-based operating system.
