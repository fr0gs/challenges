# Pomodoro Timer  

 This simple project uses angular-seed as code boilerplate in order to create another clone
 of a Pomodoro Timer clock, in order to implement the Pomodoro Technique.

 The reason behind this project is to get to know a little bit AngularJS and practice
 my skills by creating a simple project like this.

 Therefore, my code will heavily, annoyingly, and (most likely) redundantly commented,
 because I'm certain that I'll be coming back to this first project in order to refresh
 some concepts when dealing with new challenges.
